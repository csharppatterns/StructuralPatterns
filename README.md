# StructuralPatterns
Structural patterns are concernedaccross with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

## Decorator Pattern
Decorator pattern attaches additional behavior without inheritance.

## Proxy Pattern
Proxy pattern controls the creation of and access to others objects.
There are several kinds of proxies:
 - Virtual proxies. Hands creation of an object over to another object.
 - Authentication proxies. Checks the access permissions for a request.
 - Remote proxies. Sends requests across the network.
 - Smart proxies. Changes requests before sending them on.

## Bridge Pattern
Bridge pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation. It is useful when a new version of software should replace an existing version, but the older version must still run for its existing client base.
